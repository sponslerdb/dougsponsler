# 1. Data science

## Bayesian modeling

My approach to statistics is built upon rigorous Bayesian [workflow](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-02665-002), implemented with [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) and the R package [brms](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/brms/index.html).

## Causal inference using directed acyclic graphs

A statistical model can only be as good as the causal model behind it. As a data analyst, I situate my statistical models within explicit causal frameworks expressed as a directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This is especially important in observation field studies, where limited experimental control necessitates rigorous statistical control.
