# Bio

Doug Sponsler was born and raised in Philadelphia, where his love for nature grew out of time spent in urban parks and gardens. He completed his PhD in entomology at Ohio State University, did a postdoc at Penn State University, and is currently a postdoc at the University of Würzburg in Germany. From the fields of Ohio, to the rooftops of Philly, to the Alps of Germany, the theme of his work has been the relationship between flowers, insects, and people.
